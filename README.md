# Traffic-Sign-Classification
opencv

The dataset we’ll be using to train our own custom traffic sign classifier is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). {kaggle dataset}

The GTSRB dataset consists of 43 traffic sign classes and nearly 50,000 images.

In order to successfully train an accurate traffic sign classifier we’ll need to devise an experiment that can:

   1. Preprocess our input images to improve contrast.
   2. Account for class label skew.


I suggest you guys to try this on colab or cloud to train the model.
